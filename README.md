This project is a Move smart contract named `todolist`, designed to manage a simple to-do list on the Aptos blockchain. The contract allows users to create a to-do list, add tasks, and mark tasks as completed. The module is associated with the `todolist_addr` account, which is specified in the `Move.toml` file. The contract provides three main functions: `create_list`, `create_task`, and `complete_task`. The `create_list` function initializes a new to-do list under the signer's account, setting up an empty task table and an event handle. The `create_task` function allows users to add tasks to their list, assigning each task a unique ID and storing it in the task table. The `complete_task` function marks a specified task as completed, ensuring that the task exists and hasn't already been completed before updating its status. Error codes are used to handle situations where the to-do list hasn't been initialized, a task doesn't exist, or a task is already completed. The module also includes test functions to verify the correct behavior of the contract, including a full flow test that simulates creating a list, adding a task, and completing it, as well as a test that ensures an account can't complete a task without first creating a list. This smart contract is a straightforward and efficient way to manage to-do lists on the blockchain.
